## üöÄ Project Overview

As part of my learning journey to transition into a Data Analyst role, I completed a sales analysis project for a fictional chocolate company called "Awesome Chocolate." This project was a follow-along practice from a [YouTube video tutorial](https://youtu.be/ooJO7NW4uJU?si=V0W2xVqev2UzUkXq). The aim of the project was to derive insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends. I used Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore key metrics and make data-driven business decisions.
